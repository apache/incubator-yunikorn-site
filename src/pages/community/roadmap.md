# RoadMap

## What's next (future development)

- Gang scheduling
- Preemption phase 2
- Support spot instances for Spark scheduling
- Support for Kubernetes 1.17 and later

## v0.10.0

In this version, the Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) community is focusing on improving the stability, and configuration handling
The main features delivered in this release includes:

- Core scheduler cache removal [YUNIKORN-317](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-317)
- Logging and tracing enhancement using OpenTracing [YUNIKORN-387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-387)
- Kubernetes API upgrade to 1.16 [YUNIKORN-373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-373)
- Application tracking API and CRD [YUNIKORN-201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-201)
- Application and task priority support [YUNIKORN-1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-1)
- Web UI refurbishment [YUNIKORN-320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YUNIKORN-320)

## v0.9.0 (28 August 2020)

This release ships a number of improvements focussed on the user experience.

### Resource Quota Management

This version YuniKorn provides a seamless way to manage resource quota for a Kubernetes cluster, it can work as an
alternative to the [namespace resource quota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/). There are
2 main advantages of using this feature comparing to the namespace resource quota:

1. The namespace resource quota is counting resources at the admission phase, irrespective of the pod is using the resources or not.
This can lead up to issues that the namespace resources could not be efficiently used.
2. The namespace resource quota is flat, it doesn't support hierarchy resource quota management.
3. The resource quota admission controller rejects the pods as long as it goes over the quota, this increases the complexity
of the client side code.

By using the resource quota management provided by YuniKorn, it is more efficient, seamlessly setup and it provides the
job queue to handle common scheduling ordering requirements.

### Job Ordering Policy: StateAware (optimized FIFO)

The `StateAware` app sorting policy orders jobs in a queue in FIFO order, and schedule them one by one on conditions.
The condition is to wait for the application enters a runnable state. This avoids the common race condition while submitting
lots of batch jobs, e.g Spark, to a single namespace (or cluster). By enforcing the certain ordering of jobs, it also improves
the scheduling of jobs to be more predictable. More explanation of this feature can be found in doc here.

### Work with the cluster-autoscaler

In this release, YuniKorn has been tested heavily to work nicely with the Kubernetes [cluster-autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).
It brings the maximum elasticity to the Kubernetes cluster by working efficiently with the cluster-autoscaler. Some bugs
are fixed and some improvements are done in this release.

### Even cache system

In this release, an efficient even cache system is added into the scheduler. This system caches some key scheduling
events in a memory store and publishes them to Kubernetes event system when needed. More scheduling events are visible
directly from Kubernetes by using kubectl command. This helps to improve the usability and debuggability a lot.

### More comprehensive web UI

YuniKorn UI provides a better centralized view for resource management. An nodes page has been added to the UI, to display
the detailed nodes info in the cluster. The apps page has been enhanced, it now provides a search box to search apps by
queue or application ID.

## v0.8.0 (4 May 2020)

This release ships a fully functional resource scheduler for Kubernetes with a number of useful features that empower
to run Big Data workloads on K8s. See more at [Release Notes](http://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/get_started/release_notes#release-notes-v080).
